    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        "Deathclaw Wellington" is a fictional recipe inspired by the post-apocalyptic world of the Fallout video game series. This recipe, like many others in the game, combines the concept of traditional dishes with ingredients available in the wasteland.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Deathclaw steak (or substitute with a thick cut of brahmin meat)</li>
        <li>1 roll of pre-made puff pastry dough (if available)</li>
        <li>1 cup of wild mushrooms (such as glowing fungus or brain fungus)</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of butter or oil (if butter is unavailable)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: Nuka-Cola reduction sauce (a sweet and tangy glaze)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Deathclaw Steak:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you're lucky enough to have a Deathclaw steak, season it with salt and pepper. If not, a thick brahmin steak can be used as a substitute.</li>
            <li>In a skillet or pan, heat some butter or oil over medium-high heat. Sear the steak on both sides until it's browned but still rare in the center. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Saute the Mushroom and Onion Mixture:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In the same skillet or pan, add more butter or oil if needed. Saute the finely chopped onion and minced garlic until they become translucent and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the wild mushrooms to the skillet and continue to cook until they are tender and any liquid has evaporated. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Assemble the Wellington:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>On a clean surface, roll out the puff pastry dough into a rectangular sheet large enough to wrap the steak.</li>
            <li>Spread the mushroom and onion mixture evenly over the puff pastry sheet.</li>
            <li>Place the seared Deathclaw (or brahmin) steak on top of the mushroom mixture.</li>
        </ul>       
        <li>Wrap and Seal:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Carefully fold the puff pastry over the steak, ensuring it covers the entire steak and the mushroom mixture.</li>
            <li>Seal the edges by pressing them together, creating a pocket for the steak.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bake:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your makeshift wasteland oven or any available oven-like device to around 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Place the Deathclaw Wellington on a baking sheet or suitable flat surface and bake until the puff pastry turns golden brown, typically for about 25-30 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Optional Nuka-Cola Reduction:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>While the Wellington is baking, you can make a Nuka-Cola reduction sauce by simmering Nuka-Cola (or a suitable substitute) in a pan until it thickens slightly and becomes syrupy.</li>
        </ul>    
        <li>Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Once the Deathclaw Wellington is done baking, remove it from the heat source, and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Optionally, drizzle the Nuka-Cola reduction over the Wellington.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve your Deathclaw Wellington as a decadent and rare treat in the wasteland.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
