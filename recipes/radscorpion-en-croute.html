        <li>Puff pastry dough (if available)

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Radscorpion Tail:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have a radscorpion tail, clean it thoroughly, removing any stingers or tough parts. Alternatively, you can use a substitute protein like mutant rat meat.</li>
            <li>Season the meat with salt and pepper, and if possible, a pinch of wild herbs for flavor.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Wrap in Puff Pastry:
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have access to puff pastry dough, roll it out into a thin sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the seasoned radscorpion tail (or substitute protein) on the pastry sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Wrap the pastry around the meat, creating a sealed parcel.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            Bake:
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your makeshift wasteland oven or any available heat source to around 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Place the wrapped radscorpion (or substitute) on a suitable flat surface and bake until the pastry is golden brown and the meat is cooked through, typically for about 25-30 minutes.</li>
        </ul>       
        <li>
            Garnish with Wasteland Greens:
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>While your Radscorpion en Croute is baking, forage for wild herbs or greens in the wasteland.</li>
            <li>After removing the dish from the oven, garnish it with the foraged greens to add a touch of freshness and color.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            Optional Wasteland Sauce:
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you have access to scavenged condiments and spices, you can create a homemade wasteland sauce to drizzle over the Radscorpion en Croute for added flavor.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            Serve:
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Slice and serve your Radscorpion en Croute as a unique and daring wasteland culinary creation. Enjoy the unexpected combination of a flaky pastry crust with the savory protein of the wasteland.
